## Virtual Desktop Integration

This toolkit relies on [VirtualDesktopAccessor](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor) via the `pyvda` Python wrapper. A preconfigured copy is included directly in this repo to ensure reliable cross-desktop functionality out of the box.

No manual installation or compilation is needed.
